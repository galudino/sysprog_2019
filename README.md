Rutgers University
(01:198:214:02) Systems Programming
Professor John-Austen Francisco
Fall 2019

Notes:
Asst0 and Asst1 are complete. (I haven't touched them since I submitted them)

Asst2, code-wise, is complete - though the benchmarks/graphs are not.
  I may revisit this later, if it warrants my attention.

Asst3 was not complete at the time of its class submission date,
  but many changes have been made since the original submission commit,
  and is much closer to what I had planned for the project.
 
To all computer science students:

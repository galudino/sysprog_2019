<b>Rutgers University</b><br>
(01:198:214:02) Systems Programming<br>
Professor John-Austen Francisco<br>
Fall 2019<br>

Notes:<br>
<code>Asst0</code> and <code>Asst1</code> are complete.<br>
(I haven't touched them since I submitted them)

<code>Asst2</code>, code-wise, is complete - though the benchmarks/graphs are not.<br>
  I may revisit this later, if it warrants my attention.

<code>Asst3</code> was not complete at the time of its class submission date,<br>
  but many changes have been made since the original submission commit,<br>
  and is much closer to what I had planned for the project.<br>
  (in its current state, <code>Asst3</code> now fulfills at least the stated minimum requirements)
 
To all computer science students:<br>

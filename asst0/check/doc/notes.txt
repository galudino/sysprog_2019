You will have the input string,
a "cursor" variable that will keep the address of the current character position within the input string,
and an integer to keep track of the numerical index of the current expression.
Once you've separated an expression from the bulk input string,
copy it and store it with the rest of the expressions that you will be tokenizing.

Let's say we've reached our delimiter (defined to be ';')

input_string                  "3 + 2; true AND false"
cursor_variable                     ^
index                               6

copy_string                   3 + 2; true AND false

copy_string, null terminated at copy_string[6]
                              3 + 2

stash copy_string for later use with the rest of the exprs

move cursor_variable          "3 + 2; true AND false"
                                     ^

input_string (unprocessed input) is now:
                               true AND false"
                              ^ one char of whitespace before 't'

reset index to 0.
repeat until input_string depleted of chars.

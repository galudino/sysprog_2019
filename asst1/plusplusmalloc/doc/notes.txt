Basic operations for a free-list allocator:

initialize:
initialize the list

    active = true
    next = NULL;

split:
create a new_node
    size = fitting_slot->size - (split_size - sizeof(node))
    active = true
    next = fitting_slot->next
change values of fitting_slot node
    size = split_size
    active = false
    next = new_node

merge:
node curr, node prev
curr = list

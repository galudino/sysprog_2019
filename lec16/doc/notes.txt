LAST CLASS:

Signals
  software interrupt
  not necessarily an error...just something important
  that needs to be dealt with right now

  exception flavored, in that some code is invoked on your behalf
  when the event occurs
    but signals resume at the instruction running when the signal
    occurred (IF the handler does not kill the proc)

  kill sends a signal to a proc 
    - by default, sends SIGKILL

  fork
    - make a new process by duplicating the current one
  
  wait
    - suspends access of the calling process until one of its
      child processe(s) terminates
      (or waitpid() for a specific one)
        pid_t wait(int *status);
        pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int *status, int options);

int atexit(void (*function)(void));



Threads vs procs 
----------------
- threads share the same address space
  - this means it is easy to pass data between them

- kind of like a function you can call;
  but not wait for a return in order to continue
  (promote a function to be asynchronous)

- fast to build
- fast to swap between

blocking
  do not return until done
non-blocking
  may return before done
asynchronous
  always returns immediately, having started a "background"
  effort to fulfill your request

------------------------------------------------------------
POSIX Thread Library (pthreads)
------------------------------------------------------------

pthread_create()
  creates a thread

  int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr,
                     void *(*start_routine)(void *), void *arg);

  if you have multiple args,
  put it in a struct -- allocate an instance of that struct
  on the heap.

pthread_exit()
  exits a thread

pthread_join()
  waits until a thread is done and gives exit val

pthread_attr_init()

pthread_attr_destroy()

pthread_t is OPAQUE

What is an array?
  name (identifier) 
  of array is the base address of a block of memory.
  go index steps of length sizeof(typename),
    stop at capacity

What is a string:
  name (identifier) 
  of string is the base address of a block of memory.
  count bytes from base address until '\0' byte is reached

What is a function?
  name (identifier)
  of function is the base address of the instructions
  keep on consuming next (instruction) until ...
    (stop at ret) stop symbol


What is a ____?
  name (identifier)
  of ____ holds base address
  keep on consuming next (____) until (stop symbol)

  
  open
  close
  read
  write

  open(<path/filename> <flags>)
    O_RDONLY
    O_WRONLY
    O_RDWR

  open on error returns -1 and sets errno
    on term: perror <error number>

  file:
    name of (file) holds a descriptor to identify it
    keep on consuming next (byte)
    until...(EOF) stop symbol

  read/write(<file descriptor>,
             <memory location to read/write from>,
             <qty bytes to read/write>))

{
    int bytes_total = 100;
    int bytes_read = 0;
    int status = -1;

    char buffer[101];
    memset(buffer, '\0', 101);

    do {
      status = read(fd, buffer, 10);
      bytes_read += status > 0 ? status : 0;
    } while (status > 0);
}

LAST CLASS:
------------------------------------------------------------
client vs. server
  server sockets can
  server listens for connection requests (and cannot second/receive arbitrary bytes)
    - gets a client type socket from accept
  client sockets can send and receive arbitrary bytes

  to connect: IP addr and port number
  IP addr: find machine
  port: find proc on machine

  IO devices
  ----------
    character
    block
    network

  how do you know how many bytes to read?
    constant size:
      static message length
      make size of message the first thing (and have it be either a static size or delimiter)

    dynamic size:
      footer/flag

    IP address: 255.255.255.255
    every IP addr is 32 bits long

    2^32 - 1

    192.168.1.1

    Global information - lots of work to get, impossible to maintain
    Local information - easy to get and maintain....so store and forward.
    ...but only approximate
      (and no service guarantees)

    Routing:
      if myself, yay! deliver to process
      else if someone directly connected to, relay to them
      else relay to some host that has a more general IP address (manages a segment of the network)

    192.X.X.X - class A address, one octets set
    192.168.X.X - class B address, two octets set
    192.168.1.X - class C address, three octets set
    192.168.1.3 - class D address, all octets set

    Classless InterDomain Routing (CIDR)

      192.168.1.3/8
      192.168.1.3/16
      192.168.1.3/31

      Domain Name Service (DNS)
      convert from hostname to IP address

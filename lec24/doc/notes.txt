LAST CLASS:
------------------------------------------------------------
Network:
  Routing
    building a path from one host to another
      me?
      directly connected to?
        which that I am directly connected to should I relay to?
        (store and forward)

      Routing: how do the IP Addresses match?

      IP address: 255.255.255.255
      class-based 
        A. 1 octet set 
        B. 2 octets set 
        C. 3 octets set 
        D. all octets set

      classless interdomain routing:
        192.168.1.0/8
        192.168.1.0/32
        192.168.1.0/30

(least abstracted)
Please              physical
Do                  data link
Not                 network
Throw               transfer
Sausage             session
Pizza               presentation

EXAM 1 (FINAL):
  1600-1900 18 Dec CAG (College Avg Gym)

Networking (sockets)

Routing
  CIDR: Classless InterDomain Routing
  127.0.0.1/17

  localhost

  handling a message:
    - is it for me? (done!) (physical)
    - is it for someone i am directly connected to? 
    (done-ish. fwd to that machine) (data link)
    - is for someone i am indirectly connected to
    (not done - forward to machine directly connected to
    that is "closer" to the destination) (network)

    CIDR - how many bits do i match across?
    A.  1   octet  set
    B.  2   octets set
    C.  3   octets set
    D.  all octets set

    A: 192.168.120.1/8
    B: 192.168.120.1/16
    C: 192.168.120.1/24
    D: 192.168.120.1/32

    192.168.1.4/30    better match for 192.168.1.7
    192.168.1.1/16

    192.168.1.7

  ISO-OSI
  international standards organization of open systems interconnection

  (most abstracted)
  application
    interact with user
  presentation
    translates/optimizes/encryptes/decrypts data
    modify data/decode
  session
    synchronize over sockets/rules over messages/multiplex sockets
    inspects messages before they are sent before using transport layer to send it 
  transport
    messaging, quality of service, efficiency, reliability
    (socket)
  network
    route between hosts (indirect connection)
  data link
    point to point relay (directly connected)
  physical
    convert bits to radiation and vv.
  (least abstracted)

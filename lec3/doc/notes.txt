/* LAST CLASS --------------------------- */

Pointers
---------
variable that does not hold data,
        but a memory location
        (where there might be data)

&A == get the address of var A
*A == "go to the memory and address A holds"

pass by value is okay for small stuff
pass by reference/pointer better for bigger stuff

2^(n)

all pointers are the same size.

structs
-------
have memory for all fields

unions
------
have memory for largest field

/* dot op or arrow op? */
ptr_struct->field; or (*ptr_struct).field;

the addr of an array
is the same address as that of
that array's first element.

elements of arrays are on the stack.
pointers can point to something on the stack or heap.

See ch 2 or 3 for C programming man pages

using less
----------
same interface/controls as man
quit with q.

using more
----------
can only scroll down
ENTER one line
space one page
once end is reached, exit
search functionality still possible

using cat
---------
concatenates multiple files together.

/* -------------------------------------- */
& address-of operator only works with r-values

struct thing {
    int a;
};

struct thing stuff = { 123 };
struct thing *ptr = &stuff;
ptr->a = 456;   /* (*ptr).a = 456 */

*(ptr + i) == ptr[i]

((char *)(ptr) + (i * sizeof(TYPE))) == (ptr + i)

typedef
    alias a type with the id of your choice

argc - argument count
argv - const char *argv[]
    array of pointers to const char
        const char **argv
    pointer to pointer to const char

\
    escape character

pointer dereference always has precedence

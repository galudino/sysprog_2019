Header:
    definitions
    preprocessor directives (macros)
    types: enum, typedef, unions, structs..
    prototypes (function declarations)
        implementations live in libraries
    guard directives
        #ifndef DIRECTIVE
        or 
        #if !defined(DIRECTIVE)

libraries:
    implementations of functions declared in a header
    (compiled to .o files - object files)
    .o file

    gcc -c library.c
    --> library.o

    gcc main.c library.o
    ---> executable a.out with library.o

find the first block that is free
that is at least big enough to
serve the allocation

if it is really big, split it and save
the larger partition

whenever you free,
check blocks to left and blocks to right
if both free

coalesce in one direction (choose)
